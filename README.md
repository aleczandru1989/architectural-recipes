A curated collection of **architectural patterns and practices** captured as practical, reproducible **recipes**.

## 🍲 What Are Architectural Recipes?

Just like cooking recipes, each entry here is a **step-by-step guide** to solving a recurring architectural challenge.  
They are not universal truths or official standards — they are **my interpretations and practices**, shaped by real-world troubleshooting, experimentation, and learning.

Each recipe includes:

- **Ingredients** → technologies, frameworks, and tools involved  
- **Preparation steps** → how to combine them effectively  
- **Serving suggestions** → variations, trade-offs, and when to apply them
