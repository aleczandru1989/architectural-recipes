# Architectural Recipes

A curated collection of **architectural patterns and practices** captured as practical, reproducible **recipes**.  
This repository reflects **my personal understanding and experience** gained over years of hands-on work in software architecture, infrastructure, and system design.

## 🍲 What Are Architectural Recipes?

Just like cooking recipes, each entry here is a **step-by-step guide** to solving a recurring architectural challenge.  
They are not universal truths or official standards — they are **my interpretations and practices**, shaped by real-world troubleshooting, experimentation, and learning.

Each recipe includes:

- **Ingredients** → technologies, frameworks, and tools involved  
- **Preparation steps** → how to combine them effectively  
- **Serving suggestions** → variations, trade-offs, and when to apply them

## 🎯 Goals

- Capture **my real-world practices** in a reusable format  
- Provide **clear, reproducible examples** for each recipe  
- Encourage **incremental experimentation** and adaptation  
- Serve as a **study map** for advanced architectural domains
