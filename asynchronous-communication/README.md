# 📡 Asynchronous Communication Recipes

## 📖 Overview
This section explores **architectural recipes for asynchronous communication patterns**.  

The goal is to solve the problem of coordinating distributed systems where components interact without requiring immediate responses or tight coupling.

Asynchronous communication enables systems to remain responsive, scalable, and resilient even under heavy load or network variability. By decoupling senders and receivers, it allows messages to be exchanged reliably while each participant continues its work independently. This approach is foundational in modern architectures such as event-driven systems, message queues, and streaming platforms.

These recipes provide practical examples of how asynchronous communication can be implemented across different scenarios. Each pattern demonstrates a way to structure message flow, handle delivery guarantees, and achieve flexibility in system design. Together, they form a toolkit for building robust distributed applications that can evolve and scale gracefully.

By studying and applying these recipes, architects and developers can better understand the trade-offs of each communication style. Whether the need is simple point-to-point messaging or complex aggregation pipelines, these examples serve as reproducible building blocks for real-world systems.

| Pattern Name            | Apache Kafka                                                                 | RabbitMQ                                                                 |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Publish/Subscribe       | ✅ Native via topics and consumer groups                                      | ✅ Native via exchanges and queues                                        |
| Point-to-Point          | ✅ Achieved with one consumer group (only one consumer processes each message)| ✅ Native via queues (work queues)                                        |
| Request/Reply           | ❌ Not native; emulated with request/response topics + correlation IDs        | ✅ Native via direct reply queues (AMQP RPC)                              |
| Routing (Content-based) | ❌ Not broker-level; must be done in consumers or Kafka Streams               | ✅ Supported via header/topic exchanges                                   |
| Filtering               | ✅ Consumers filter messages; Kafka Streams supports advanced filtering       | ✅ Supported via bindings, selectors, and consumer-side filtering         |
| Aggregation             | ✅ Supported via Kafka Streams / ksqlDB                                       | ✅ Supported via plugins or consumer logic                                |
| Transformation          | ✅ Supported via Kafka Streams / Connect transforms                           | ✅ Supported via message converters, plugins, or consumer logic           |
| Dead Letter Queue       | ❌ No native delay; Implemented via DLQ topics                                | ✅ Native DLX (Dead Letter Exchange) support                              |
| Competing Consumers     | ✅ Multiple consumers in a group share partitions                             | ✅ Multiple consumers share a queue, broker load-balances                 |
| Priority Queues         | ❌ Not native; emulate via separate topics                                    | ✅ Native support for priority queues                                     |

| Transactional Messaging | ✅ Exactly-once semantics, transactional producers/consumers                  | ✅ Transactions and publisher confirms                                    |
| Replay / Event Sourcing | ✅ Consumers can rewind offsets, reprocess history                            | ❌ Not native; messages consumed are gone unless re-queued                |
| Batch Processing        | ✅ Native batch polling, windowed aggregation via Streams                     | ✅ Possible via consumer prefetch, but less central                       |

## ⏩ Point to Point
Point‑to‑point communication is a messaging pattern where a message is sent to a specific queue, and only one consumer receives and processes it. Unlike publish/subscribe models where multiple subscribers may consume the same message, point‑to‑point ensures exclusive delivery — once a consumer reads the message, it is removed from the queue and cannot be consumed again.
- Producer → Queue → Consumer
- Guarantees one‑to‑one delivery.
- Useful for task distribution (e.g., job processing, work queues).
- Ensures load balancing when multiple consumers listen to the same queue, since each message is delivered to only one of them.

## ⏩ Publish/Subscribe (Pub/Sub)
Publish/Subscribe (pub/sub) communication is a messaging pattern where producers (publishers) send messages to a topic, and multiple consumers (subscribers) can receive those messages. Unlike point‑to‑point, where only one consumer processes a message, pub/sub enables one‑to‑many delivery — every subscriber to a topic gets a copy of the message.
- Producer → Topic → Multiple Subscribers
- Guarantees broadcast delivery to all active subscribers.
- Useful for event distribution (e.g., notifications, real‑time updates).
- Promotes loose coupling, since publishers don’t need to know who the subscribers are.

## ⏩ Request/Reply
Request/Reply is a messaging pattern where a producer sends a request and expects a reply. The broker delivers the request to a consumer, which processes it and returns a response, often using correlation IDs or a reply queue.
- Producer → Request Queue → Consumer → Reply Queue → Producer
- Ensures one‑to‑one request/response matching.
- Useful for RPC‑style communication (e.g., queries, synchronous workflows)

## ⏩ Routing (Content‑based)
Routing (Content‑based) is a messaging pattern where the broker inspects message headers or payload and directs each message to the appropriate destination. Unlike simple broadcast models, routing ensures that only the relevant consumers receive the message based on defined rules.
- Producer → Broker → Destination Queue(s)
- Routes messages by content (e.g., region=EU → EU service).
- Useful for selective delivery, reducing unnecessary traffic

## ⏩ Filtering
Filtering is a messaging pattern where consumers receive only the messages that match specific criteria. Instead of processing every message, subscribers define rules (such as headers or properties) to limit delivery to relevant events.
- Producer → Broker → Consumer (with filter)
- Ensures selective delivery based on conditions.
- Useful for reducing traffic and focusing on relevant data
