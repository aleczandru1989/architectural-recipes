# 🛒 Micro‑Frontend Composition

## 📖 Overview
This section of the repository explores **architectural recipes for micro‑frontend composition**.  

The goal is to solve the problem of building a modular application where independent MFEs (Micro‑Frontends) can be composed together into a unified user experience.

Micro‑frontends provide a way to scale development across multiple teams by allowing each team to own a distinct slice of the application. This approach reduces coupling, improves maintainability, and enables independent deployment cycles, ensuring that features can evolve without waiting for monolithic release schedules.
